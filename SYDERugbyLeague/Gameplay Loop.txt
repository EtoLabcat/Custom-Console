////////////SRL Gameplay Loop

16 Teams In A Season
 - These can be generated randomly or grabbed from the current saves

2 Modes - Manager & Spectator
 - In manager mode, the player gets given options after every game to have an attempt to raise the stats of players
 - In spectator mode, the player gets given a betting allowance and makes bets on the outcome of the games

 Every game is generated, no actual rugby league gameplay
